intro-to-coding
===============

I just started coding about 9 months ago.  I've taken C, C++, and Data Structures class only and using GitHub to get better at coding.  I've worked in the Environmental Consulting field for 8 years and would like to change careers.  I have been told by several people that working on community projects is one of the best ways to develop one's programming abilities.

I will attempt to produce some C++ code for a simple game with Text based graphics for my first goal based on the board game HeroQuest.  Any help or encouragement is appreciated.

Thanks,
-Pat
